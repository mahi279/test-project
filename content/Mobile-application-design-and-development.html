With a mobile app, you can bring your business to your customers instead of them coming to you, and if there’s anything that attracts people besides free stuff, it’s convenience.

It is only natural that it seems easier said than done.Though it may seem like it is impossible, we believe that everything is possible, and that the impossible just takes a little longer.

Convenient, isn’t it? A small little app to cater to all your business needs. With a mobile application, customers are only one-touch away on their phone screens to your business, and nothing screams loyalty like ‘Thank god I don’t have to get up and drive and find a parking spot’ convenience.   
												<br/>
												As this relies heavily on your business requirements, consumer needs and enterprises, come meet with us and tell us what you need, we’ll work closely with you in full transparency to deliver not what you want, but what you need.
												<br/>
												Your mobile app will cater to your customers’ needs with your business’ services with efficiency, the same way Ecdo will cater to your needs with ours.

											NATIVE MOBILE APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT
											Native mobile app development is smartphone software developed with specific programming language. In iOS we develop native app with Objective C or Swift. Whereas in Android, we program with Java and Android Studio. Native mobile app has better performance and user experience than other types of development such as hybrid app developed with specific UI frameworks.
											SUITABLE FOR PROJECTS THAT REQUIRES
											HIGH PERFORMANCE MOBILE APP
											BEST USER EXPERIENCE
											UI CONTROLS & EXTENSIBILITY
											HIGH MOBILE APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT BUDGET
											Native app is built for a particular device and operating system. Native apps has the ability to use device-specific hardware and software that take advantage of the latest technology available on mobile device. Therefore native mobile app provides the best performance and functionality as compared to hybrid mobile app.
											User Experience
											Native mobile app provides the best user experience in terms of speed and stability of the mobile application developed with native technology. User can experience the best UI/UX interactivity with native mobile application as native mobile app is fully developed with their specific operating system in mind such as iOS and Android that has its own UI/UX patterns and designs to develop mobile apps.
											Unleash the full potentials of Smartphone functionalities with native mobile application development. Native mobile app development is 100% compatible with iOS and android phone devices dependent functionality such as GPS, bluetooth, NFC, Accelerometer and many more other device enabled functionalities.
											Native mobile applications have the best performance among those framework based hybrid mobile applications or web HTML5 mobile applications. This is due to the code is written directly on top of the operating system instead of using a translator layer to convert to native code which will degrade the performance of the mobile application which was developed.
											HYBRID MOBILE APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT
											As compared to native mobile app, the hybrid mobile apps have advantages on cost of development. Due to the portability of source code hybrid mobile application development can easily deploy on multiple platforms.
											SUITABLE FOR PROJECTS THAT REQUIRES
											FASTER TIME TO MARKET
											MODERATE USER EXPERIENCE
											NO DEPENDENCY ON NATIVE FEATURES
											CHEAPER TO DEVELOP ON MULTI-PLATFORMS
											Hybrid mobile application development contains the strength of both the native and HTML5. Hybrid mobile apps is primarily built using HTML5 and JavaScript, and then wrapped inside a thin native container that provides access to native platform features. Phone Gap is an example of the most popular container for creating hybrid mobile apps with native container.
											Hybrid mobile application technology is meant to build one source base and shared across multiple platforms deployment such as iOS, Android, Microsoft Windows and black berry. Although it may not be 100% portable across platforms, however it help developer to save at least 50% to 70% of time to reuse same source base across platforms and focus on the parts that are platform specific and required different handling with different platforms.
											Hybrid mobile application development allow developer to port over to different platforms with lesser time, therefore having a mobile apps that support multiple platforms has is much easier with native mobile app development. Due to this advantage of hybrid mobile application development, time to market is much faster as compared to native mobile application development. Hybrid mobile apps development is especially useful for start-ups project and prototyping purposes.
											Hybrid mobile apps requires developer to focus on only one technology framework and able to develop across platforms. Hybrid technology also requires less time to develop across multiple platforms as compared to native mobile apps development. Therefore, cost of mobile apps development in relation to time and expertise required is much lower. When comparing with native mobile apps development.
